  "articleBody": " Let's Dream a Bit: What's Education's Future Looking Like? Imagine you stumble into a hidden treasure chest, and inside, you find a magical book. But it’s not just any old book. This book talks to you, grows with you, teaches you everything you need to know—and I mean everything, from arithmetic to the secrets of the universe. It becomes your mentor, your guide, and your best friend.\nSound like a fairytale? It’s actually the world of The “The Diamond Age”. In this shimmering world of endless possibilities, a young girl named Nell finds just such a book: the Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer’. And this book isn’t just a clever gadget; it’s a marvel of artificial intelligence. It doesn’t just educate Nell; it shapes her, molds her, and guides her destiny.\nWhat if this isn’t just a story? Then, and more importantly: What would it mean to be a teacher in that era?\nHold that thought, because we’re about to dive into the deep end of AI in education. Together, we’ll explore what’s happening right now, what’s around the corner, and what enchanting possibilities emerge when we blend human hearts with machine minds.\nTogether, we’ll delve into the essence of teaching, understanding what is believed to make Teachers unique, and see how AI is shaping up to take on similar roles. We’ll explore the present and peer into the future to grasp what it could mean to teach in this new paradigm.\nReady? Let’s jump in.\nFrom Stone Tablets to Smart Tablets: The Evolution of Teaching Let’s hop in our imaginary time machine and travel back, way back, to when humans were first figuring things out. Picture a prehistoric parent teaching their kid how to make a fire or catch a fish. It’s not like they had a classroom or textbooks; it was all about watching, learning, and trying not to get eaten by something bigger!\nFrom Stone Tablets to Paper Now, fast forward to the time when people began to scribble down their thoughts. That was a game-changer! Suddenly, we could share knowledge, not just with our neighbors but with people far, far away. That led to the birth of schools, where the hottest job to land was a scribe. Imagine that, going to school just to learn how to write things down!\nClassrooms Today But education never stays the same, does it? In ancient Greece, school wasn’t just about learning a trade; it was about becoming a good person. Fast forward again, and you’d find monks and priests running schools, spreading the good word. Hit the Renaissance, and bam! Science and art are back on the menu.\nThen comes the Industrial Revolution, education took a turn towards standardization, making way for uniform curricula and assessments, and opening doors to mass schooling. This era marked the beginning of professional teacher training, the integration of technology in the classroom, and a shift towards new educational goals, such as fostering critical thinking.\nThese changes reflected the demands of an industrialized society, yet they also sparked debates about creativity and individuality, laying groundwork for today’s complex educational landscape.\nSo, Who's That in Front of the Class? So here’s the thing: What does it mean to teach? Are there systemic traits inherent to the act of teaching, whether you live in 12,000 BC or 2023 AD?\nTeachers: They Wear SO Many Hats! That is a tough question. What if we start with wondering what makes a great teacher? I mean, besides the endless patience and magical ability to explain algebra? The qualities I’m about to describe humbly reflect the teachers I had the chance of witnessing, there might be much more, but it probably is a good starting point.\nLet’s break it down:\nThe Know-It-All (But in a Good Way): Teachers aren't just smart; they're constantly learning, staying on top of their game. Whether it's history, math, or the latest trends in science, they've got to be experts, not just for themselves, but for their students. The Mind Reader: Well, not exactly, but Teachers do need to understand how their students' brains work. They've got to know when to push, when to pull back, and when to turn the whole lesson upside down to make it click. It's a dance, and the teacher's leading! The Storyteller: Good luck trying to explain quantum physics without being able to tell a good story. Teachers are communicators, breaking down the toughest ideas into bite-sized pieces, all while listening to their students, figuring out where they're stuck. The best Teachers I know always have this magical ability to anticipate what you’ll be thinking 5-6 steps ahead before it clicks, a feat that requires at least all three skills mentioned earlier. It’s kind of like playing the game of Go, where both the student and the teacher win, but it’s far more complicated, with many factors that are hard to define coming into play.\nNow, with all the buzz about AI, it’s time to peel back the curtain and see what’s really possible. We’ll take a step-by-step journey, exploring what AI can (and might soon) do regarding each of these skills.\nTrust me; this isn’t just futuristic chatter. The future is here, and it’s fascinating! Grab your seat; class is in session!\nAI In Education - It's Not Science Fiction! Arificial Intelligence: Brief History The concept isn’t new at all! It dates back to the ’50s; what has really changed since is our computational power. But really, the first truly self-driving car dates back to the ’80s, for example. The car was driving on an empty straight highway - making the problem infinitely simpler, and the computer needed about 10 minutes to analyze ONE image.\nNow, to keep it simple; let’s just remember that AI does two things very very well: classify (is it a cat or a dog?) and predict (what’s next?).\nGame-Changers: Moments When AI Really Shook Things Up! So, you’ve probably heard about AI defeating humans at board games and solving incredibly complex problems. Cool, right? But what’s going on under the hood? Let’s unravel this mystery.\nA while back, Google’s DeepMind won at Go using something called Reinforcement Learning (another thing at which AI is really good btw). Imagine a virtual player that learns by maximizing its winning points in a game. Kind of like levelling up in a video game!\nThen came the protein folding challenge, one of the toughest puzzles around. DeepMind tackled it with a system that mimics human attention. It’s like when you’re in a busy room, but you can, and know how to, focus on your friend’s voice only to make sense of what’s going on – the model does the same with data. Boom!\nHow's This All Work? Let's Get Intuitive Ever wondered how AI can finish your sentences? It is all about sequence and memory.\nLet’s say you write the following sentence: An AI model called a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), after training, can guess the next word easily. It’s like predicting the next note in a nursery rhyme.\nBut toss in a longer sentence like:\nAnd the traditional RNNs gets confused. They can struggle with long sequences of data*. It’s akin to trying to remember the beginning of a really long joke; the further you get, the harder it becomes to recall the start.\nNow, when processing sequential data, no matter how good the memory, at some point, there’s a loss of important information that affects the understanding of the underlying dynamics.\nEven for our brain, this is true. Think of it: if I ask you to tell me about your holidays, and to borrow a thought from Daniel Kahneman;\n99% of the experience is forgotten.\nYour mind focuses on specific moments, then builds the story you tell me based on those key memories.\nThat introduces the Transformers, first mentioned in the paper “Attention is All You Need” (2017). Unlike RNNs, Transformers don’t necessarily process data in sequential order. Instead, they use mechanisms like attention to find and learn patterns, regardless of their position in the sequence.\nThis allows them to identify and attend to what’s important, making them faster (because done in parallel), better at processing very long sequences, and excellent at predicting the next word in this case.\nAnd that, dear reader, changes everything.\nFUN FACT: In between typical RNNs and Transformers, appeared models like Long Short-Term Memory networks(LSTMs). They have better memory than typical RNNs but can be too slow for very long sequences and don't have as good memory as Transformers. However, they were a significant improvement over traditional RNNs, and could, for example, predict the continuation of Schubert's 'Unfinished Symphony'(No 8). Large Language Models - A Revolution Meet GPT, BART, LLaMa, and other Large Language Models (LLMs). These remarkable creations aren’t just another tech buzzword; they’re revolutionizing the way we interact with information.\nPeeking Behind the Curtain Well, LLMs leverage the attention mechanism and are trained on an enormous amount of text data. They also have billions of parameters fine-tuned in the training phase to capture the highly complex patterns that can be found in the data.\nNow, think of them as trying to guess the next word in a sentence, then using that word, along with all the preceding words, to predict the following word. This process continues word by word (a method known as auto-regressive modelling), until - voilà 💫 - a coherent piece of text that resembles human writing is created.\nYou might be thinking, that’s it? Wait a minute! While these models could run on a Mac, training one of them takes more than a quick click. We’re talking about a massive investment of time, energy, and, yes, cold hard cash. The processes of collecting, cleaning, sometimes even tagging, and correcting data, not to mention the sheer computing power required, costs a fortune.\nThe result is impressive tho! LLMs are like super-smart conversation partners that can write, summarize, translate, and even get creative.\nSome folks might even think they’re empathetic or able to reason, but hold your horses – they’re not quite there yet. They mimic understanding by finding patterns in data, kind of like recognizing a dance move without knowing how to dance.\nThese LLMs are changing the game! Imagine talking to a computer and having it understand your requests as easily as a human assistant. It’s not just feasible; it’s happening. From business tasks to the education realm, they’re taking on roles that were once pure fantasy.\nAre We Close to Seeing Star Trek Tech in Schools? Are we close to the Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer from The Diamond Age? Not quite.\nBut AI is evolving faster than you can say Self-Supervised Learning or Liquid Neural Network (don’t worry, we’ll save that for another article). The future’s knocking, and it’s loaded with potential.\nWith what we’ve covered so far, it’s clear that AI is getting pretty good at playing the ‘know-it-all’ and the ‘storyteller,’ just like some of the best Teachers out there.\nWhat’s left? The Mind Reader. And that is the topic of the next section, let’s explore how this technology might fit into the classroom and shake up education.\nBuckle up; it’s getting deeper!\nThe Foundation of AI in Edducation: Ever Heard of Knowledge Space Theory? Ever felt like classroom tests were missing something? They tell you what’s wrong but not why or what to do next. Enter Knowledge Space Theory (KST), our learning GPS. It’s a brilliant way to see where a student stands and what needs to be mastered next. And it was born to fix what’s wrong with traditional testing.\nKST Explained: It's Cool, Promise! Crafted by Jean-Paul Doignon and Jean-Claude Falmagne back in 1985, KST isn’t a dusty old relic but a brilliant mathematical framework that takes “knowledge points” and maps out an individual’s “knowledge state” for any given subject. It’s about understanding what’s been mastered and what hasn’t. No more confusion, no more one path for all.\nImagine taking a specific knowledge, say Grade-4 multiplication. Then this knowledge is broken down into the smallest possible items; here 4 items: A, B, C and D.\nThe starting point is the empty state; { 0 }, and the full mastery of the later is the full state when the student masters all 4 items; { A, B, C, D }.\nIn between these two states there are many different mastery sequences where the students progresses by adding to her “knowledge portofolio” one item at the time. All the possible sequences are defined by experts; for instance, the student needs to master A before learning B or C. The end result is the “knowledge space” or structure that is illustrated below.\nNow, picture your student tackling Grade-4 multiplication. With KST, we can see what she’s mastered at t time (say A and C) and what’s left (maybe B or D). It’s a clear roadmap, showing where she is, without guessing where to go next.\nIt’s like having a GPS for learning, always pointing you in a good direction.\nBut Hey, There’s More! Brief Intro Into LST If KST is the map, Learning Space Theory(LST) is the compass that points to the BEST next step, based on what the student is ‘ready to learn’. It doesn’t just say, “Here’s where you are, and where you could go”; it says, “Here’s what you’re ready to learn next”.\nThink of it as the GPS that takes you in the best direction.\nAI in Classrooms: More Than Just Sci-Fi Dreams? Think this is all just theoretical mumbo jumbo? Think again! The ALEKS platform in the US, which spans from K-12 to higher education, has put KST to the test. And guess what? It works! Studies show that this system significantly narrows the divide between top performers and those lagging behind. There’s still a road to travel, but we’re definitely on the right track. And with innovators like SquirrelAI joining the journey, the horizon looks even brighter.\nSo, where does all this lead us?\nAI Across the Globe: Education's New BFF? A Quick Peek: Who's Leading the AI EdTech Scene? The future of education is unfolding with Artificial Intelligence (AI), projected to reach a market size of USD USD 30 billion by 2032. The landscape features key players such as Khan Academy, ALEKS, and Carnegie Learning, all pushing the boundaries. However, underlying this growth is the same essential question of the role of Teachers in the 21st century.\nThe Two Schools of Thought: AI Replacing Human Teachers: Efficiency and Success Leading Leading this school of thought is Squirrel AI, China’s trailblazer in AI-driven education. Nearly 2,000 AI-learning centers and expansion into global markets only scratch the surface of their success. Squirrel AI has proven its capability to seriously accelerate student learning using KST and Machine Learning. Their approach emphasizes efficiency, delivering results in less time, an accomplishment that cannot be overlooked.\nYet, it’s not without its challenges. In an interaction with Karen Hao (MIT Technology Review), a student’s request for more human interaction reflected a nuanced aspect of this AI-led education model.\nAI Augmenting Human Teachers: Harmonny and Human Touch On the other side, companies like ALO7 and Carnegie Learning represent the belief that AI can work in harmony with human Teachers. Their success stories include millions of students served and several awards won.\nALO7 integrates AI into home practice while retaining the human touch in classrooms for creative skills. Carnegie Learning, recognizing the irreplaceable value of human Teachers, uses AI to enhance their mathematics platform.\nAlright, so here’s the scoop. AI’s making waves in education, and there’s a lot to be excited about. From Squirrel AI’s lightning-fast learning techniques to ALO7’s human touch, there’s no denying that tech’s got some serious game.\nBut here’s where things get a bit tricky. While AI is nailing the adaptive learning thing (that’s tailoring lessons based on what you know and don’t know), it hasn’t quite figured out the personalized touch that only a real-live teacher can bring.\nThus… is this where Teachers still have an advantage?\nAdaptive, Personalized: What’s the Best Recipe for Learning? Adaptive Learning: a simple GPS for Studying Imagine you’re on a road trip, and your GPS knows every turn you need to take but doesn’t care if you prefer the scenic route or the highway.\nThat’s kind of like adaptive learning, championed by companies like ALEKS and Squirrel AI. It’s all about understanding exactly what students know and don’t know, and guiding them along the quickest path to understanding. It’s precise, it’s efficient, but it doesn’t necessarily take into account what students want to know or the ways they enjoy learning.\nPersonalized Learning: Remember When It Was All About Us? Now, imagine a GPS that asks you if you want to see the mountains, stop by a famous landmark, or grab a coffee on your road trip.\nThat’s more like personalized learning. It’s not just about the destination; it’s about the journey. It’s all about learning what students are interested in and how they learn best.\nJutta Treviranus, Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University, underscores this point:\n“We need students to understand their own learning. We need them to determine what they want to learn, and we need them to learn to learn.” This perspective resonates with the global shift towards inclusive and innovative education, particularly in regions like China, where a “quality-oriented education” emphasizing creativity and liberal arts has gained momentum in the past years.\nHere’s where it gets interesting. In the world we live in today, both adaptive learning and personalized learning can be handed over to sophisticated AI*. Yep, you heard that right! Think of it as the Facebook or TikTok algorithms for education.\n*That involves having access to a huge amount of data of course.\nLet’s Daydream: What's Teaching Gonna Look Like Tomorrow? Whew, we’ve covered a lot of ground! Take a deep breath, and let’s take a moment to digest what we’ve uncovered.\nA Little Recap AI in education isn’t just a dream; it’s practically knocking on the door. We’re on the brink of a world where machines can take on many of the complex tasks that we’ve always considered uniquely human. They’re learning to master knowledge, to converse, and to guide students on their educational journeys.\nNow, don’t get me wrong, we’re not quite there yet. The future is promising, very promising indeed - but there are still a few ‘wrinkles’ to iron out.\nStill Got Questions? Me Too, Let’s Seek Some Answers So what? What will become of Teachers?\nSometimes the answers to complex questions come from the most ‘unexpected’ places. Feeling a bit stumped, I decided to take a step back and ask someone with a fresh perspective.\nOut of the Mouth of Babes: What Kids Think About Teachers I turned to my 13-year-old nephew and asked him what he thought a teacher should be.\nHis response was both profound and touching: ‘A teacher should be an adult’ he said, recognizing the need for authority. But he didn’t stop there. With a sincerity that only a child can muster, he added, ‘A teacher should be a friend.’\nHis words lingered in my mind.\nThrowback! What Can Old Philosophers Teach Us Today? The simple yet profound words of a 13-year-old took me back to the time of Socrates. This famous philosopher never saw himself as a traditional teacher. Instead, he likened his role to that of a midwife of ideas. Socrates wasn’t about spoon-feeding information; he was about sparking conversations, engaging his students in dialogues, and leading them to truths they would discover on their own. It’s about learning to learn.\nHis student Plato carried this torch but added his touch of formalism when he founded the Academy. While still honoring dialogue and philosophical inquiry, Plato brought structure to his teaching. He presented his ideas systematically, engaging his students in comprehensive exploration.\nBoth Socrates and Plato were more than just educators; they were inspirational figures, mentors challenging the status quo. They were trailblazers, pushing boundaries in ways that resonate even today. They barely had syllabi or even structured programs and were still fantastic Teachers. It’s about nurturing the inquisitive mind in a way that’s inherently human.\nBeing human entails much more than what words can convey. Just think about what you’re feeling while reading these words - there lies our answer.\nHeart \u0026 Soul of Teaching: It’s More Than Just Books No matter where you stand on the spectrum of AI-led or augmented education, we can agree on one profound truth: there’s an aspect of teaching where AI might never fully reach human levels. It’s in the very essence of what it means to be a Teacher, the ability to mentor, inspire, and ignite a fire within students.\nImagine the magic when a respected mentor recognizes a student’s potential, the transformation that can occur, unlocking abilities once hidden. That is the Art of teaching, something uniquely human, rooted in our empathy, our understanding, our connection to one another. It’s a part of us that AI may strive to emulate, but can it ever truly grasp the nuance of human emotion?\nPerhaps in the distant future, when AI reaches the point of empathetic sentience, this question might be challenged. But until then, the core of teaching remains a human Art form, an extraordinary endeavor that transcends mere information sharing and blossoms into something deeply meaningful and personal.\nWrapping Up: Teachers, The Unsung Heroes Crafting Our Future We often overlook something so vital, something that shapes the very foundation of our societies: the role of Teachers.\nIt’s not just a job; it’s a noble pursuit, a calling that extends far beyond the classroom. Teachers are tasked with a remarkable challenge, one that demands both adapting to our ever-changing world and forecasting its future course. It’s about aligning with the direction society is moving, nurturing the minds that will one day lead us there. In this profound responsibility, Teachers weave the fabric of our future, shaping what’s to come. They are the architects of tomorrow, and we owe them our deepest respect and support.\nNamasthe.\n",

<p>Let&rsquo;s break it down:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Know-It-All (But in a Good Way):</strong> Teachers aren't just smart; they're constantly learning, staying on top of their game. Whether it's history, math, or the latest trends in science, they've got to be experts, not just for themselves, but for their students.</li>
  <li><strong>The Mind Reader:</strong> Well, not exactly, but Teachers do need to understand how their students' brains work. They've got to know when to push, when to pull back, and when to turn the whole lesson upside down to make it click. It's a dance, and the teacher's leading!</li>
  <li><strong>The Storyteller:</strong> Good luck trying to explain quantum physics without being able to tell a good story. Teachers are communicators, breaking down the toughest ideas into bite-sized pieces, all while listening to their students, figuring out where they're stuck.</li>

    <strong>FUN FACT:</strong>
    In between typical RNNs and Transformers,
    appeared models like <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/time_series/time_series_lstm_model.htm">Long Short-Term Memory networks</a>(LSTMs).
    They have better memory than typical RNNs but can be too slow
    for very long sequences and don't have as good memory as Transformers.
    However, they were a significant improvement over traditional RNNs,
    and could, for example, <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/unfinished-symphony-no-8-ai-huawei">predict</a> the continuation of Schubert's
    '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCo8Feho1RI">Unfinished Symphony</a>'(No 8).

<p>Both Socrates and Plato were more than just educators; they were inspirational figures, <strong>mentors challenging the status quo</strong>. They were trailblazers, pushing boundaries in ways that resonate even today. <strong>They barely had syllabi or even structured programs and were still fantastic Teachers</strong>. It&rsquo;s about nurturing the inquisitive mind in a way that&rsquo;s inherently human.</p>
<p>Being human entails much more than what words can convey. Just think about what you&rsquo;re feeling while reading these words - <em><strong>there lies our answer.</strong></em></p>
<h3>Heart & Soul of Teaching: It’s More Than Just Books</h3>

<p>Imagine the magic when <strong>a respected mentor recognizes a student&rsquo;s potential</strong>, the transformation that can occur, <strong>unlocking abilities once hidden</strong>. <strong>That is the Art of teaching</strong>, something uniquely human, rooted in our <strong>empathy</strong>, our understanding, our connection to one another. It&rsquo;s a part of us that AI may strive to emulate, but can it ever truly grasp the nuance of human emotion?</p>
